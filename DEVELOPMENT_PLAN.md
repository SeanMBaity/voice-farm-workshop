# ðŸŒ¾ Voice Farm Game - Development Plan

## ðŸ§  Ultrathinking Analysis

### User Journey Analysis
**Fastest path to value**: Users need to feel the joy of voice-controlled farming immediately
- "Wow" moment: "Alexa, plant tomatoes" â†’ see visual seed planting â†’ hear confirmation
- Core loop must work end-to-end before adding complexity
- Visual + Audio feedback is crucial for emotional connection

### Technical Dependencies
**Critical Path**: Alexa Skill Foundation â†’ Voice Intents â†’ APL Visuals â†’ Data Persistence â†’ Advanced Features
- Must have: Basic skill â†’ Plant/Water/Harvest intents â†’ Visual feedback â†’ Growth timers
- Can parallelize: Audio assets with visual development, testing with implementation

### Testing Strategy
- **Milestone 1**: Can I plant, water, and harvest crops with voice? (Core loop working)
- **Milestone 2**: Do I see my farm and get visual feedback? (APL integration)
- **Milestone 3**: Do crops grow over time and persist? (Growth timers + persistence)
- **Milestone 4**: Can I progress and unlock new content? (Progression system)

### Risk Assessment
- **Biggest risk**: Alexa Skill complexity - start simple, add features incrementally
- **APL learning curve**: Visual layer is complex - begin with basic layouts
- **Growth timer implementation**: Real-time persistence is critical - get data model right early
- **Voice recognition**: Natural language processing - start with exact phrases, expand later

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Milestones

### Milestone 1: Core Voice Loop (Week 1)
**Goal**: "I can plant, water, and harvest crops using my voice"
- Basic Alexa Skill with Plant/Water/Harvest intents
- Simple voice responses with audio confirmation
- In-memory crop state (no persistence yet)
- Basic testing on Echo device

### Milestone 2: Visual Farm Experience (Week 2)  
**Goal**: "I can see my farm and watch it respond to my voice"
- APL templates for farm visualization
- Visual crop states (planted, growing, ready)
- Animated responses to voice commands
- Echo Show compatibility

### Milestone 3: Growth & Persistence (Week 3)
**Goal**: "My crops grow over time and remember my progress"
- DynamoDB integration for data persistence
- Real-time growth timers for crops
- User session management
- Crop maturity notifications

### Milestone 4: Progression & Polish (Week 4)
**Goal**: "I can unlock new crops and feel progression"
- XP and leveling system
- New crop types unlock over time
- Enhanced audio and visual feedback
- Basic subscription framework
