# ðŸŒ¾ Voice Farm Game Workshop - AI Assistant Context

## Project Overview
This is an AI workshop project for building a voice-first farming game for Amazon Alexa devices. The goal is to demonstrate AI-assisted development workflows and create a working prototype.

## Workshop Context
- **Duration**: 90 minutes
- **Goal**: Build working software with AI assistance
- **Target**: Non-technical participants learning AI development
- **Project**: Voice Farm Game for Amazon Alexa

## Tech Stack
- **Platform**: Amazon Alexa Skill SDK v2 (Node.js)
- **Database**: DynamoDB for persistence
- **Visuals**: Alexa Presentation Language (APL) for Echo Show
- **AI Integration**: GPT-4o for conversational mascot
- **Audio**: S3-hosted sound effects and voice lines
- **Monetization**: Alexa In-Skill Purchasing API

## Workshop Workflow
1. **PRD Parsing**: Convert PRD into GitHub issues
2. **Feature Development**: Build features with AI assistance
3. **Automation**: Watch GitHub Actions validate and merge code
4. **Iteration**: Continue building with the established workflow

## Development Rules
1. **AI-First**: Use AI for all development tasks
2. **Voice-First Design**: Every feature must work with voice commands
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality works on Echo, enhanced on Echo Show
4. **User Experience**: Focus on calming, non-stressful interactions
5. **Workshop Pace**: Keep things simple and demonstrative

## Success Criteria
- Voice command success rate (>90%)
- Session length (5-10 minutes target)
- User retention (D1: 60%, D7: 30%, D30: 15%)
- Subscription conversion (5% target)

## Current Focus
Building the core farming loop: Plant â†’ Water â†’ Wait â†’ Harvest â†’ Progress

## Workshop-Specific Guidelines
- **Keep it simple**: Focus on demonstrating AI workflows
- **Show progress**: Each step should be visible and measurable
- **Explain the process**: Help participants understand AI-assisted development
- **Celebrate wins**: Acknowledge successful AI interactions
