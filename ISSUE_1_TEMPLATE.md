# Issue #1: Parse PRD into Development Tasks

## 🎯 Overview
**Parent Issue**: None (this is the foundation)
**Blocks**: All future development issues
**Depends On**: None (starting point)
**Estimated Time**: 20 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy
**First-Time Contributors**: Yes! Perfect starting point - no dependencies, clear scope

## 📍 Context for Newcomers
This issue converts your Product Requirements Document (PRD) into actionable development tasks. The PRD contains your project vision, but we need to break it down into specific, testable features that can be built incrementally.

Think of it like creating a recipe from a menu description. The PRD says "we want a delicious cake" - this issue breaks that down into "mix flour, add eggs, bake at 350°F for 30 minutes."

## 📂 Files to Work With
- `docs/prds/current/PROJECT_PRD.md` - Your Voice Farm Game requirements
- `templates/PRD_PARSING_PROMPT.md` - AI prompt to parse the PRD
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/newcomer-standard-issue.md` - Template for creating subtasks

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Read and understand the Voice Farm Game PRD
- [ ] Use the PRD parsing prompt to analyze requirements
- [ ] Create 4-6 subtask issues from the PRD
- [ ] Each subtask follows the newcomer-standard-issue template
- [ ] All subtasks are linked as dependencies of this issue
- [ ] Subtasks cover the core farming loop: Plant → Water → Wait → Harvest

## 🏗️ Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Read the PRD
1. Open `docs/prds/current/PROJECT_PRD.md`
2. Understand the core features and user stories
3. Identify the main milestones and deliverables

### Step 2: Use AI to Parse PRD
Use this prompt with your AI assistant:
```
I want to work on issue #1 "Parse PRD into Development Tasks".

Please:
1. Read the PRD from docs/prds/current/PROJECT_PRD.md
2. Read the PRD parsing prompt from templates/PRD_PARSING_PROMPT.md
3. Use that prompt to parse the PRD into 4-6 subtask issues
4. Create each subtask issue on GitHub using the newcomer-standard-issue template
5. Link them all as subtasks of issue #1

Repository: [YOUR-USERNAME]/voice-farm-workshop

Show me the commands for each subtask issue.
```

### Step 3: Create Subtask Issues
The AI will help you create issues like:
- Issue #2: Setup Alexa Skill Foundation
- Issue #3: Implement Core Intent Handlers
- Issue #4: Create Farm Data Models
- Issue #5: Build Visual APL Templates
- Issue #6: Add Audio and Sound Effects

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
- Verify each subtask has clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure subtasks can be completed in 1-2 days each
- Check that subtasks build on each other logically
- Confirm all core PRD features are covered

## 🚫 Out of Scope
- Implementing the actual features (that's for the subtasks)
- Detailed technical design (that comes in each subtask)
- UI/UX mockups (those are separate tasks)

## 📊 Success Metrics
- 4-6 well-defined subtask issues created
- Each subtask has clear acceptance criteria
- Subtasks follow a logical development sequence
- All core PRD features are represented
