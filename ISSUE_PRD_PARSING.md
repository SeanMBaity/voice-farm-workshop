# Parse Voice Farm Game PRD into Development Tasks

## üéØ Overview
**Parent Issue**: None (this is the foundation)
**Blocks**: All future development issues
**Depends On**: None (starting point)
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy
**First-Time Contributors**: Yes! Perfect starting point - clear scope, uses AI assistance

## üìç Context for Newcomers
This issue uses AI to transform our Voice Farm Game PRD into actionable development tasks. Our PRD describes a cozy farming game for Amazon Alexa where users plant, water, and harvest crops using voice commands. We need to break this vision down into specific, testable features that can be built incrementally.

Think of it like creating a construction blueprint from an architect's vision. The PRD says "build a beautiful voice-controlled farm" - this issue breaks that down into "create plant intent handler", "add watering animations", "setup crop timers", etc.

## üìÇ Files to Work With
- `docs/prds/current/PROJECT_PRD.md` - Voice Farm Game requirements
- `prompts/PRD_PARSING_PROMPT.md` - AI prompt template for parsing PRDs
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/newcomer-standard-issue.md` - Template for creating subtasks

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Read and understand the Voice Farm Game PRD completely
- [ ] Use the PRD parsing prompt with AI to analyze requirements
- [ ] Create 4-6 milestone-based subtask issues from the PRD
- [ ] Each subtask follows the newcomer-standard-issue template format
- [ ] All subtasks are linked as dependencies of this issue
- [ ] Subtasks cover the complete farming loop: Plant ‚Üí Water ‚Üí Wait ‚Üí Harvest ‚Üí Progress
- [ ] Each milestone delivers user-testable functionality
- [ ] Issues are ordered by technical dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Read the PRD Thoroughly
1. Open `docs/prds/current/PROJECT_PRD.md`
2. Understand the target users (women aged 30-65)
3. Identify core features vs nice-to-have features
4. Note technical requirements (Alexa Skill, APL, DynamoDB)
5. Review the 4 defined milestones

### Step 2: Use AI to Parse PRD
Copy this prompt and use it with your AI assistant:

```
I want to work on parsing our Voice Farm Game PRD into development tasks.

Please:
1. Read the PRD from docs/prds/current/PROJECT_PRD.md
2. Read the PRD parsing prompt template from prompts/PRD_PARSING_PROMPT.md  
3. Apply the ultrathinking process to analyze our Voice Farm Game requirements
4. Create 4-6 subtask issues following the 100x detailed format
5. Organize issues into the 4 milestones defined in the PRD:
   - Milestone 1: Core Loop Prototype (Plant/Water/Harvest)
   - Milestone 2: Visual Farm & Notifications  
   - Milestone 3: Progression + Subscription
   - Milestone 4: Mascot + GPT-4o Integration

Each issue should:
- Be completable in 1-2 days
- Include specific Alexa Skill code examples
- Cover both voice interaction and APL visuals
- Have clear testing instructions for Echo Show devices
- Follow the newcomer-standard-issue template

Repository: [YOUR-USERNAME]/voice-farm-workshop

Show me the exact GitHub issue content for each subtask.
```

### Step 3: Create Subtask Issues
The AI will help you create issues like:
- Issue #2: Setup Alexa Skill Foundation with Basic Intents
- Issue #3: Implement Plant/Water/Harvest Intent Handlers  
- Issue #4: Create APL Visual Templates for Farm Display
- Issue #5: Add Crop Growth Timers with DynamoDB Persistence
- Issue #6: Build Progression System with XP and Unlockables
- Issue #7: Integrate GPT-4o Powered Farm Mascot

### Step 4: Link Dependencies
- Add "Blocks: #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7" to this issue description
- Add "Depends On: #1" to each subtask issue
- Link related issues within milestones

## üß™ Testing Instructions
- Verify each subtask has clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure subtasks can be completed in 1-2 days each
- Check that subtasks build on each other logically
- Confirm all core PRD features are covered across issues
- Validate that each milestone delivers testable user functionality
- Ensure Alexa-specific requirements (APL, voice intents) are included

## üö´ Out of Scope
- Implementing the actual features (that's for the subtasks)
- Detailed technical architecture (comes in implementation issues)
- UI/UX mockups beyond what's in the PRD
- Non-MVP features like multiplayer or weather events

## üìä Success Metrics
- 4-6 well-defined subtask issues created
- Each subtask maps to PRD requirements
- Issues follow logical development sequence
- All 4 PRD milestones are represented
- Each issue includes Alexa Skill specific guidance
- Subtasks cover voice interaction + visual display
- Clear path from empty repo to working farm game

## üéÆ Voice Farm Game Specific Notes
Our PRD targets:
- **Platform**: Amazon Alexa (Echo Show, Echo Dot, Fire TV)
- **Audience**: Women aged 30-65 who enjoy casual farming games
- **Core Loop**: Plant ‚Üí Water ‚Üí Wait ‚Üí Harvest (5-10 minute sessions)
- **Tech Stack**: Alexa Skills Kit, APL for visuals, DynamoDB for persistence
- **Key Features**: Voice commands, visual feedback, growth timers, progression system

Make sure subtasks address both the voice interaction AND visual components for Echo Show devices.
